# Examination of Diamonds dataset with Histogram graph

The relationship between the categorical variables of the diamond dataset in the Seaborn library and the Price was examined using a Barplot chart. In addition, two categorical variables were crossed at the same time and their relationship with the continuous variable Price was examined. How to do it in the graphics is indicated in the necessary comments.
